title: What is Astro?
---

Astro is a __static site generator__ for building __fast__, __content-driven__ websites.

It makes it easy to build simple sites with great SEO and limited tooling.

Astro is:
- __content-driven__: great for blogs or landing pages
- __server-first__: rendering happens in the server - better for speed and SEO
- __simple by default__: just HTML/CSS/JS in a consistent structure
- __expandable__: tons of integrations and optional access to the top JS frameworks
