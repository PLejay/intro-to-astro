title: Server-first, with hydration
---

By default, all Astro components are __pre-rendered at build time__, with __zero JavaScript sent to the browser__.

Additional tooling can add __server-side rendering__ or __client-side interactivity__ using JS/TS or any popular JS framework.

Astro components are __composable__ and __reusable__, similar to other JS frameworks. They accept props and child elements ("slots").
