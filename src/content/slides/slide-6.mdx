If you want to build a simple site quickly while leaving room for experimentation, Astro is a fairly safe way to go, with a [pretty good tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) and documentation.

Modern web development can feel pretty complex at times, but thanks to tools like Astro, anyone can build a website relatively painlessly. Don't let fear get in the way of you bringing your ideas to life.
