title: Content collections
---

Astro supports writing content in __markdown files__ (or .mdx files for dynamic content) that can be imported within components and will be rendered into HTML.

Files can be organised into __collections__ with standardised formats, metadata and type checking.

> These slides are written in markdown

Each file will generate its own page if placed within the `src/pages` directory or using Astro methods in a `[...slug]` page
