<AnatomyOfAFile />

A basic .astro file consists of specific sections:

1. __frontmatter__: javascript (or typescript) that runs only in the server, always behind a code fence (`---`)

2. __component template__: determines the html output. Contains plain html but can also include:

   - __other astro components__
   - __javascript expressions__
   - __\<style> tags__: css scoped to the component
   - __\<script> tags__: javascript that runs in the client
